<h2><br>1 Cup of Simmering Water and some more, if you wish to pre-heat the equipment used to brew tea.
    <br>1 TBsp 2 to 3 Grams of Loose Leaf Black Tea.
    <br>Optional Milk Lemon, Sugar, Honey, etc.
    <br>Instructions
    <br>Place the water in a tea kettle and heat it between 200° and 212°F.
    <br>Pre-heating the teapot or cup in which the tea will be served (optional). It is always good to do so before you pour the boiling water into it because the temperature of the water may drop down immediately if the pot or cup is not warm.
    <br>Measuring the tea leaves, undoubtedly an important step. Up to two grams of black loose tea leaves can be added to make one perfect cup of tea.
    <br>Place the tea leaves in the pot or cup, either directly or in an infuser, and pour water over them.
    <br>Place the lid on the teapot, or if using a cup, cover the cup with a lid or a small saucer.
    <br>Let it steep for 3 to 5 minutes. It’s best to taste your tea after 3 minutes and then after every 30 seconds until it satisfies your taste.
    <br>As soon as the tea is ready, remove the leaves by lifting out the infuser or pouring the tea through a strainer. (The taste may vary if the leaves are not removed on time)
    <br>You can add milk and honey to sweeten your tea. Many people also prefer adding lemon and sugar cubes to their tea. If you add milk, heat it gradually by adding the milk to the cup first and then pouring in the tea. Avoid combining milk and lemon
    together as the milk may curdle.

    <br>How to Make Black Tea
    <br> If you like your tea strong, you may add more tea leaves rather than cooking it for a longer time. For if you cook it for a very long time, it may become bitter. Make sure that you boil your tea at least 2 to 3 times to bring out the complete
    flavor of the tea leaves. Also, the water that you use to make black tea also plays an important role. You should never use distilled water to brew your tea as it may make the black tea taste flat. Using fresh water is the best choice you can make.
